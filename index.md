<center>“Just that you do the right thing. The rest doesn’t matter.</center>
<center>Cold or warm.</center>
<center>Tired or well-rested.</center>
<center>Despised or honored.</center>
<center>Dying . . . or busy with other assignments.</center>
<center>Because dying, too, is one of our assignments in life. There as well: “to do what needs doing.”</center>
<center>― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</center>
